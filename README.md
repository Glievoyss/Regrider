## 🔍 Overview

**Regrider** is a vector wave model of light propagation that introduces the concept of a **local moving wave medium** — the _regrider_ — in which light maintains a constant speed **C**. This model preserves the predictions of Special Relativity (STR) as a particular case but provides an expanded framework for understanding light behavior in moving systems and boundaries between media.

Key features:

- Light speed remains **C** in its **own local medium**
- External observers may register apparent speed changes due to motion of the medium
- Doppler effects are interpreted as **boundary phenomena**
- The model generates testable experimental predictions
- STR is recovered when regrider velocity **Sk = 0**

## 📐 Key Formula

Generalized propagation distance over time from external observer's frame:

```math
S_total = C + (ℓ · |Sk| · cos(θ)) / C
```

Where:

- `C` = speed of light in local medium
- `Sk` = velocity of the regrider relative to external observer
- `ℓ` = length traveled within the regrider
- `θ` = angle between light direction and Sk
